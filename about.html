<div class="post">
  <p>I have recently graduated IIT Palakkad in the stream of Computer Science and engineering. I am interested in Functional programming and Mathematics, hence I have a natural predilection towards Haskell. I contribute to the Open Source community whenever possible. I use Vim for most of my tasks, my work environment is basically Vim + Tmux. I prefer the Z shell (with oh-my-zsh) over Bash and I like playing Dota 2. I aim to become a core contributer to the Haskell community in the near future.</p>
<p>Currently I’m working as a student developer at Haskell.Org under Google Summer of Code. I’m working on implementing acyclic graphs and extending the alga library.</p>
<h1 id="research-interests">Research Interests</h1>
<p>My researches interests emerged from trying to understand Haskell. I’m on a path to learn the mathematical concepts behind Haskell. My research interests include <em>Category Theory</em>, <em>Type Theory</em> and <em>Proof Assistants</em>. My final year B.Tech project consists of creating a Haskell library from ground-up for IPFS (Interplanetary File System). I am also required to build all the dependencies of IPFS or use standard Haskell libraries. One such library is Raaz, a cryptographic library used for hashing. Since the Raaz library was created and is maintained by my Project advisor and Professor, Dr. Piyush Kurur, I had the fortunate advantage of learning more about how Raaz functioned. It’s a pretty cool library, you can check it out on hackage.</p>
