sub: A little about me.
---

I have recently graduated IIT Palakkad in the stream of Computer Science and engineering.
I am interested in Functional programming and Mathematics, hence I have a natural predilection towards Haskell.
I contribute to the Open Source community whenever possible.
I use Vim for most of my tasks, my work environment is basically Vim + Tmux.
I prefer the Z shell (with oh-my-zsh) over Bash and I like playing Dota 2. 
I aim to become a core contributer to the Haskell community in the near future.

Currentlt I'm working as a student developer at Haskell.Org under Google Summer of Code.
I'm working on implementing acyclic graphs and extending the alga library.

### Research Interests
My researches interests emerged from trying to understand Haskell. I'm on a path to learn
the mathematical concepts behind Haskell. My research interests include *Category Theory*, *Type Theory* and 
*Proof Assistants*.
My final year B.Tech project consists of creating a Haskell library from ground-up for IPFS (Interplanetary File System).
I am also required to build all the dependencies of IPFS or use standard Haskell libraries. 
One such library is Raaz, a cryptographic library used for hashing. 
Since the Raaz library was created and is maintained by my Project advisor and Professor, Dr. Piyush Kurur, 
I had the fortunate advantage of learning more about how Raaz functioned.
It's a pretty cool library, you can check it out on hackage.

### Recent Projects

**Alga - Haskell.Org, Google Summer of Code** 
([Github](https://github.com/adithyaov/alga) | Ongoing) 

- Implementing type-safe acyclic graphs in alga.
- Extending the alga library to include many useful algorithms.

**Implementing IPFS in Haskell** 
([Github](https://github.com/ipfs-haskell) | Ongoing) 

- Building libraries in Haskell for Inter Planetary File System (A distributed ﬁle system). 
- This will require building all the major libraries from ground-up. 
- Currently working on building libraries to for implementing Kademlia (A distributed Hash table) in Haskell.

**Online Voting**
([Github](https://github.com/adithyaov/online_voting) | Ongoing)

- An online voting application with the main motto of anonymity and security. 
- Using the RSA (RivestShamirAdleman) blind signatures for veriﬁcation of the vote. 
- Back-end and the Blind Signatures implemented using Golang
- Currently building the front-end using ReasonML (strictly typed functional programming which compiles to Javascript)

**Eﬃcient Parking Allocation - India Singapore Hackathon**
([Github](https://github.com/adithyaov/eﬃcient-parking-allocation))

- An eﬃcient automated parking allocation system built during 36 hours of continuous coding. 
- Used OpenCV for image stitching and detecting the location of the vehicle. 
- Used a norm 2 diﬃng algorithm to check the existence of the vehicle routinely. 

**General Scheduler - Smart India Hackathon**
([Github](https://github.com/adithyaov/general-scheduler))

- A scheduler built for scheduling school or college courses (can be extended to schedule anything). 
- Converted the scheduling problem into a Boolean formula with over 16000 variables. 
- Used the z3 solver to solve the Boolean formula to get results satisfying the constraints
